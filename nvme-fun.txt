If you want to overprovision, instead of creating a smaller partition, you can
make a smaller namespace. Ofc only if the controller supports changing your
namespaces.

Next time I reformat or get a new NVMe I want to try: --block-size=4096. Usually
the emulated blocksize is 512, but a bigger blocksize should improve
performance. Compatibility tho?
