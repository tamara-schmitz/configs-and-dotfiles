You can tweak Electron apps using Experimental flags!

Just tweak a normal Chromium browser on `chrome://flags`. These tweaks are
turned into Chrome launch parameters which we can use for Electron.
Go to `chrome://version` and under command line copy everything from `--flag-switches-begin` until `--flag-switches-end`.

Example flags that you might want to use on Linux:
`--flag-switches-begin --enable-gpu-rasterization --ignore-gpu-blocklist --enable-features=CanvasOopRasterization,EnableOopPrintDrivers,UseSkiaRenderer,WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns --flag-switches-end`

With these flags copied, find the .desktop file of your application. It might be under /usr/share/applications.
In the line beginning with `Exec` paste your flags after the path to the binary and before any other arguments if there are any.

Now next time you launch your application it should be using your flags. Check your task manager by searching for your application like slack or discord.
